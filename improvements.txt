POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS:
- add more screens, maybe with different configurations
- add a more elaborate bouncing logic on the paddle (not symmetric, but depending on WHERE on the paddle the ball bounces)
- improvements to fonts, background and style in general, to make the game more beautiful visually
- minor tweaking on numeric parameters, e.g. checks on bounces, screen size, block dimension and distance...
